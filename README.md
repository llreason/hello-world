Liang Li's first repository

Hi everybody!

I am Liang Li. This is my first try to learn the Python language on Github.
For the past 30 years, my life had always been controlled by other people, espically by my parents.
Career, lifestyle, friends, hobbies, even girls in contact with me.
I don't want my life to be decided by other people anymore.
I am eager to find the way out of the present dilemma.

Now I am ready, let's start!
